# Long-Term-Investor-Detection-with-ML-Engage-with-the-Investment-Community-s-Stalwarts.
EliteBank aims to improve its marketing strategy by using data analytics to identify prospective long-term depositors and investors. By predicting high-value clients in advance, the bank can deploy targeted incentives and optimize marketing efforts, reducing waste and improving customer retention and profitability.
 In specifics, the desires of the administrative board can be summarized as follows:

     Develop a ML model capable of predicting the probability of a customer becoming a long-term investor. 
     Explore attempts to demystify and explain the predictions made by the model. 

To be more specific, the specific challenges of interest to EliteBank Industries are:

     Client Segmentation: The bank has a diverse customer base, and segmenting clients based on their long-term potential is complex, but rewarding process; it provides deeper understanding of the clientele. 
     Resource Allocation: Effective resource allocation was essential. The bank needed to focus marketing and advisory efforts on clients with long-term potential. 
    Risk Mitigation: EliteBank needed to identify clients who might be at risk of leaving and take proactive measures to retain them.

Rationale For The Project

Predicting long-term deposit makers and investors was crucial for EliteBank to enhance customer engagement, optimize resource allocation, and drive long-term profitability. Accurate predictions could enable the bank to offer tailored services and strengthen client relationships. Other advantages include:

     Client-Centric Approach: The project aligned with EliteBank's commitment to providing tailored solutions that meet the evolving needs of its clients. 
     Enhanced Customer Retention: By identifying clients likely to become long-term investors, the bank aims to improve customer retention rates. 
    Competitive Advantage: Accurate predictions would position EliteBank as a leader in using data-driven insights to deliver value to clients.

Aim Of The Project

The aims of the project are:

     Develop ML Models for Detecting Potential Investors: Develop predictive models to identify clients likely to become long-term deposit makers and investors. 
     Feature Selection (and Engineering): Identify (and engineer) relevant features that contribute to accurate detection of potential investors. 
    High Specificity: Ensure the model exhibits high specificity to minimize false negatives.

Data Description

You have carte blanche to request whatever data you require. Based on your wealth of experience, you know you require:

     Client information: Information on the customer’s profession e.g., job, marital status, education, etcetera. 
     Financial history: Financial information on the bank clientele e.g., account balance, any previous deposits, etcetera.  
    Deposit labels: Labels describing whether or not the customers made investment deposits.

Tech Stack

The programming language of use, as in most of ML, is Python.

The Python libraries of interest for this project are:

     NumPy: Numerical computation  
     Pandas: Data munging and manipulation 
     Matplotlib and Seaborn: Data Visualization 
    Sci-kit Learn: Machine Learning

Project Scope

Exploratory Data Analysis: The data is thoroughly explored and analyzed to gain insights and understand its characteristics. This involves statistical analysis, data visualization, and other exploratory techniques to identify patterns, correlations, anomalies, and potential issues in the data.

Feature Selection (and Engineering): Not all features provided in data may be of relevance to the target. Feature selection is the process by which we can select the most appropriate of these according to a specified set of criteria. The data features might also be composable to give more informative features.

Model Development: Various modelling techniques are applied to the prepared data in this stage to build predictive or descriptive models. This can include machine learning algorithms, statistical models, or other analytical approaches. The models are trained, validated, and fine-tuned to optimize their performance.

Model Evaluation and Selection: Once the models are developed, they are evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics and validation techniques. This involves assessing their performance, generalizability, and robustness. The best-performing model(s) are selected for further deployment or refinement, and attempts to explain why they work and what they learn are made.
